# On-Chain News Verification Network

**Project Name:** Zander

**Value Proposition:**

Zander gives people a way to verify news transparently and without relying on any single organization to decide what's true. By putting news and it's verification process on-chain, anyone can see how conclusions were reached. In a world where AI generated misleading content is growing fater than traditional fact checkers can react, this platform offers a comunity driven, economy backed way to understand what's real.

**Key Differentiator:**

Most fact checking today jappens behind closed doors, with users having to trust an organization's judgement. This system flips that model by letting truth emerge from the community itself through stake backed voting. Verifiers are rewarded for being accurate and penalized for being careless, creating honest incentivites baked directly into the protocol. Everything from votes to final truth flag is recorded on-chain, making the process transparent and fair. This creates a more open and trustworthy alternative to traditional fact checking, built for the challenges of the current AI era.
